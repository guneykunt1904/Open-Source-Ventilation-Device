# Mechanical Information

General difficulty of this project was that I don't have 3D printer and some mechanical equipments so I did most of the work by hands.Just pulley was produced by Övgü Kavas.<br>
So If you have 3D printer or other facilities you can draw and produced more effective parts.<br>

## PARTS 
* ARM
* PULLEY
* PLATFORM 
* HINGE 
* ADDİNG POİNT
### ARM 
It is produced from PVC water pipes.As you can see there are holes on it.I drilled these holes so that it can be more light because in these design we
are using pushing power of BWM bag so if it is too heavy the bag can't push it.If you print part like this it can be more lighter than I produced 
maybe you don't need to drill the part.Also I mentioned in the readme.md If you use longer arm perhaps you can use less powerfull stepper motor
because of increased torque by arm.

I use hinge so that arm can move freely according to the force that is exerted by motor.

I There are more photos int the [photos folder](https://github.com/guneykunt1904/Open-Source-Ventilation-Device/tree/master/Mechanical%20Parts/Photos).Also there measurements of parts

### PULLEY

Pulley might be the most critial part of the project because It pull the belt and the arm. There is a bolt at the middle of the pulley which  
connected to belt.I am using M4 bolt.Measuerements of pulley is in the [Photos](https://github.com/guneykunt1904/Open-Source-Ventilation-Device/tree/master/Mechanical%20Parts/Photos)folder

Pulley is produced from Aluminum

### PLATFORM

Platform holds the BWM bag and there is a hinge that is connected to arm.Measurements is on [Photos](https://github.com/guneykunt1904/Open-Source-Ventilation-Device/tree/master/Mechanical%20Parts/Photos)folder
<br>
In the platform part I strongly recommend to use plastic but here I could only use wood because I can only procces the wood.
As you can see in the photos there is a half circle at the platform.The radius of this circle is 70mm.

### HİNGE 
Here hinge doesn't satisfy everything because I can find only this but It works.
